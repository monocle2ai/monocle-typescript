Task Decomposition is the process of breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks.
This technique is particularly useful in AI and programming when solving complex problems.
Task Decomposition helps in better organization, parallel execution, and simpler debugging of code.
It allows teams to work on different components simultaneously and improves overall efficiency.

When implementing Task Decomposition:
1. Identify the main problem or task
2. Break it down into logical subtasks
3. Determine dependencies between subtasks
4. Assign priorities to each subtask
5. Implement solutions for each subtask
6. Integrate the solutions back together

Task Decomposition is commonly used in Agile methodologies, AI planning systems, and large software projects.
