Chat Completion Result:
An Americano is a type of coffee drink that consists of espresso diluted with hot water. The result is a coffee that has a similar strength to traditionally brewed drip coffee but with a distinct flavor profile due to the espresso base. The typical preparation involves pulling a shot or two of espresso and then adding hot water to achieve the desired strength and volume. The ratio of espresso to water can vary according to personal taste, but a common ratio is roughly 1 part espresso to 2 parts water. An Americano can be served hot or iced.
