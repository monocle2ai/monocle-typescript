Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks.\\nCoffee production begins when the seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits (coffee cherries) are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles. Coffee is brewed from the ground roasted beans, which are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor. There are also various coffee substitutes.\\nBlack\\nBlack coffee is as simple as it gets with ground coffee beans steeped in hot water, served warm. And if you want to sound fancy, you can call black coffee by its proper name: cafe noir. Since it isn’t doctored up with milk or sugar, the quality of coffee is especially important. Treat yourself to a coffee subscription box to find your favorite style.\\n\\nLatte\\nAs the most popular coffee drink out there, the latte is comprised of a shot of espresso and steamed milk with just a touch of foam. It can be ordered plain or with a flavor shot of anything from vanilla to pumpkin spice.\\n\\nCappuccino\\nCappuccino is a latte made with more foam than steamed milk, often with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or cinnamon on top. Sometimes you can find variations that use cream instead of milk or ones that throw in flavor shot, as well.\\n\\nAmericano\\nWith a similar flavor to black coffee, the americano consists of an espresso shot diluted in hot water. Pro tip: if you’re making your own, pour the espresso first, then add the hot water.\\n\\nEspresso\\nAn espresso shot can be served solo or used as the foundation of most coffee drinks, like lattes and macchiatos.\\n\\nDoppio\\nA double shot of espresso, the doppio is perfect for putting extra pep in your step.\\n\\nCortado\\nLike yin and yang, a cortado is the perfect balance of espresso and warm steamed milk. The milk is used to cut back on the espresso’s acidity.\\n\\nRed Eye\\nNamed after those pesky midnight flights, a red eye can cure any tiresome morning. A full cup of hot coffee with an espresso shot mixed in, this will definitely get your heart racing.\\n\\nGalão\\nOriginating in Portugal, this hot coffee drink is closely related to the latte and cappuccino. Only difference is it contains about twice as much foamed milk, making it a lighter drink compared to the other two.\\n\\nLungo\\nA lungo is a long-pull espresso. The longer the pull, the more caffeine there is and the more ounces you can enjoy.\\n\\nMacchiato\\nThe macchiato is another espresso-based drink that has a small amount of foam on top. It’s the happy medium between a cappuccino and a doppio.\\n\\nMocha\\nFor all you chocolate lovers out there, you’ll fall in love with a mocha (or maybe you already have). The mocha is a chocolate espresso drink with steamed milk and foam.\\n\\nRistretto\\nRistretto is an espresso shot. It uses less hot water which creates a sweeter flavor compared to the bitter taste of a traditional shot of espresso or a doppio.\\n\\nFlat White\\nThis Aussie-born drink is basically a cappuccino without the foam or chocolate sprinkle. It’s an espresso drink with steamed milk.\\n\\nAffogato\\nThe affogato is an excuse to enjoy a scoop of ice cream any time of day (and any time of year in my opinion). Served with a scoop of ice cream and a shot of espresso, or two. The affogato is extra delicious served over a brownie, as a Brownie Affogato Sundae.\\n\\nCafé au Lait\\nCafé au lait is perfect for the coffee minimalist who wants a bit more flavor. Just add a splash of warm milk to your coffee and you’re all set!\\n\\nIrish\\nIrish coffee consists of black coffee, whiskey and sugar, topped with whipped cream.\",\"id\":\"coffee-info\"}"]}}],"links":[],"resource":{"attributes":{"service.name":"bedrock-opensearch.app"}}}
